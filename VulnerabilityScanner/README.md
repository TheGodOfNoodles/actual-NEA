# NEA Web Vulnerability Scanner

A CustomTkinter desktop application that performs a lightweight crawl of a website, runs a couple of basic security checks, and presents the findings in beginner-friendly language.

## Features

- Crawls same-domain links (up to 15 pages, depth-limited) to gather content.
- Submits simple payloads to HTML forms to look for reflected XSS and SQL error leakage.
- Reviews the first response for missing baseline security headers and HTTPS usage.
- Exports a human-readable report of the issues discovered.

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How the Scan Works

The bundled scanning engine uses the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries to make real HTTP requests. It follows links within the target site, tests a small set of forms with carefully chosen payloads, and looks for common warning signs such as reflected input or SQL error strings. The checks are intentionally conservative so they can run quickly and avoid intrusive behaviour, but they provide practical feedback for introductory security learning.

Use the tool only on websites you own or have explicit permission to test.
